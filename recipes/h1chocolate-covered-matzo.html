    <p><strong>Another tasty desert for my shoko poko</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray (such as PAM)</li>
        <li>4 unsalted matzo boards, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
        <li>&#190; cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray; arrange matzo boards to fit in a single layer, breaking if necessary.
        </li>

        <li>Transfer baking sheet into the preheated oven and immediately reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) if the matzo are smoking too much.</li>
        <li>Remove baking sheet from oven and sprinkle matzo with chocolate chips. Let stand to melt chocolate, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Spread melted chocolate over matzo; place in refrigerator until chilled and set. Break into pieces when cooled.
